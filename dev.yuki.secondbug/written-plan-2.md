# Multimedia Authoring 2 - Crushing Bugs Assignment

This is for the 2nd problem.

2. The puzzle game ends with all the puzzles in the drop zone on reset or choosing a new puzzle

The second problem is the drop zone has been placed all puzzles, and buttons of other puzzles are only for switching to specific puzzle pictures. However, the puzzles from the last game are still remained on the puzzle board unchanged. There are several attempt to fix this problem, in term of removing child on the drop zone, and move the puzzles pictures back to the original drag zone when any puzzle buttons were clicked.

Research of remove child, if function for counting elementchild and return, nodechild, true/ false and let function have been explored.
